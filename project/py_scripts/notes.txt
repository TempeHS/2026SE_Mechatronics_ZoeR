stuff for reference
things to check if robot isnt working
 - code (debugging stuff, the usual)
 - connection (use V01 file/LED light)
 - wiring (sighhhhhhh)
 - make sure batteries arent dead because you forgot to turn them off and they were on all night, what a silly thing to do i would never make such a stupid mistake hahahaha

servo
 - right backwards, left forwards - moves robot forwards
 - right forwards, left backwards - moves robot backwards
 - right servo - pin 18, left servo - pin 20

 ultrasonic sensor
  - front sensor - 0000 (i think?)
  - side sensor - 0010 

to-do
 - get colour/line sensor to work
 - get lcd to work
 - get lcd to display when over the colour green
 - fix import errors
 - make sure robot stops before running into walls
    - if front ultrasonic distance is less than a certain amount (like 1-2cm)
    - check if side ultrasonic distance is also less than a certain amount (however long the robot is when it turns + a couple of cm)
       - if YES - turn in that direction
       - if NO - turn in the other direction


theory stuff checklist
 - SRS document - do at home
 - flowchart - DONE 
 - lv0 DFD - DONE
 - lv1 DFD - do at home
 - UML class diagram - do at home
 - wiring diagram - DONE (probably...)
 - power supply diagram - 
 - power supply calculations - 
 - online simulations..?
 - photos of the robot - DONE
 - github repository - well you tell me 
 - online simulations for unit tests
 - ACTUAL unit tests - DONE (mostly)
 - justification - i'm going to disappear into the woods under mysterious circumstances and no-one will hear from me for a week. not done. do at home.
